            Fans use the Platform to be matched with Talent, like you, who choose to participate in Video Calls. By
            participating in a Video Call, Talent can raise funds for Non-Profit Partners that are designated by Talent,
            in his or her sole discretion. The Non-Profit Partners designated by Talent for the Video Call then receive
            fundraising proceeds in Meetlete’s name proportionate to the amount Talent has designated for that
            particular Video Call </p>

          <p>From time to time, a Fan may request a Video Call from you through the Platform. You may have up to
            fourteen (14) days and three (3) attempts to complete the Video Call. If you do not either: (i) accept the
            request and complete the Video Call; or (ii) decline the request, the request will expire and can no
            longer
            be fulfilled. You may decline a request or otherwise refuse, in your discretion, to participate in a Video
            Call if a Fan’s request is objectionable or otherwise offensive to you. If you accept a request, you will
            complete the Video Call. </p>

          <p> Meetlete retains the right, in its sole discretion, to cancel any request from a Fan. No payment will be
            made to you for any declined, cancelled or unfulfilled Video Call request.</p>
