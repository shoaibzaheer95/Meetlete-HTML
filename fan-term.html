          connect with professional athletes who have been accepted to the Platform (“<b>Talent</b>”). From time to
          time, Fans may create a thirty (30) second introduction video about themselves, and subsequently request one
          or more video calls of three (3) or more minutes (each, a “<b>Video Call</b>”) from Talent through the
          Platform. Talent has up to seven (7) days and three (3) attempts to complete the Video Call with the Fan. If
          Talent does not either: (i) accept the request and complete the Video Call; or (ii) decline the request, the
          request will expire and can no longer be fulfilled. If Talent accepts a request, you will complete the Video
          Call. By participating in a Video Call, Talent can raise funds for charitable organizations that are
          designated by Talent, in his or her sole discretion (each, a “<b>Non-Profit Partner</b>”). The Non-Profit
          Partners designated by Talent for the Video Call then receive fundraising proceeds in Meetlete’s name
          proportionate to the amount Talent has designated for that particular Video Call.

        <p>2.1. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Services.</b> The Services, and any parts thereof, are protected by copyright
          laws throughout the world. Subject to this Agreement, Meetlete grants you the right to access and use the
          features and functionality of the Services, as well as a limited license to reproduce portions of Services for
          the sole purpose of using the Services for your personal or internal business purposes. Unless otherwise
          specified by Meetlete in a separate license, your right to use any part of the Services is subject to the
          Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>2.2. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Application License.</b> Subject to your compliance with the Agreement,
          Meetlete grants you a limited non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to
          download, install and use a copy of the Application on a single mobile device or computer that you own or
          control and to run such copy of the Application solely for your own personal or internal business purposes.
          Furthermore, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Apple App Store (an
          “<b>App Store Sourced Application</b>”), you will only use the App Store Sourced Application (a) on an
          Apple-branded product that runs the iOS (Apple’s proprietary operating system) and (b) as permitted by the
          “Usage Rules” set forth in the Apple App Store Terms of Service. Notwithstanding the first sentence in this
          section, with respect to any Application accessed through or downloaded from the Google Play store (a
          “<b>Google Play Sourced Application</b>”), you may have additional license rights with respect to use of the
          Application on a shared basis within your designated family group.
        </p>
        <p>2.3. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Updates.</b> You understand that the Services are evolving. You acknowledge
          and agree that Meetlete may update the Services with or without notifying you. You may need to update
          third-party software from time to time in order to use the Services.
        </p>
        <p>2.4. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Certain Restrictions.</b> The rights granted to you in the Agreement are
          subject to the following restrictions: (a) you shall not license, sell, rent, lease, transfer, assign,
          reproduce, distribute, host or otherwise commercially exploit the Services or any portion of the Services,
          including the Platform, (b) you shall not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo,
          or other Services (including images, text, page layout or form) of Meetlete; (c) you shall not use any
          metatags or other “hidden text” using Meetlete’s name or trademarks; (d) you shall not modify, translate,
          adapt, merge, make derivative works of, disassemble, decompile, reverse compile or reverse engineer any part
          of the Services except to the extent the foregoing restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable law;
          (e) you shall not use any manual or automated software, devices or other processes (including but not limited
          to spiders, robots, scrapers, crawlers, avatars, data mining tools or the like) to “scrape” or download data
          from any web pages contained in the Platform (except that we grant the operators of public search engines
          revocable permission to use spiders to copy materials from the Platform for the sole purpose of and solely to
          the extent necessary for creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or
          archives of such materials); (f) you shall not access the Services in order to build a similar or competitive
          website, application or service; (g) except as expressly stated herein, no part of the Services may be copied,
          reproduced, distributed, republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any
          means; and (h) you shall not remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings contained
          on or in the Services. Any future release, update or other addition to the Services shall be subject to the
          Agreement. Meetlete, its suppliers and service providers reserve all rights not granted in the Agreement. Any
          unauthorized use of any Service terminates the licenses granted by Meetlete pursuant to the Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>2.5. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Third-Party Materials.</b> As a part of the Services, you may have access to

          materials and that you access these materials at your own risk.

          agree that you shall monitor your Account to restrict use by minors, and you will accept full responsibility
          for any unauthorized use of the Services by minors. You may not share your Account or password with anyone,
          and you agree to (y) notify Meetlete immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or any other
          breach of security; and (z) exit from your Account at the end of each session. If you provide any
          information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Meetlete has reasonable grounds to

          right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Services (or
          any portion thereof). You agree not to create an Account using a false identity or information, or on behalf
          of someone other than yourself. Meetlete reserves the right to remove or reclaim any usernames at any time
          and for any reason, including but not limited to, claims by a third party that a username violates the third
          party’s rights. You agree not to create an Account or use the Services if you have been previously removed
          by Meetlete, or if you have been previously banned from any of the Services.
        </p>

        <p>3.3. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Necessary Equipment and Software.</b> You must provide all equipment and
          software necessary to connect to Services, including but not limited to, a mobile device that is suitable to

          responsible for applying the appropriate level of access to Your Content. If you do not choose, the system may
          default to its most permissive setting. You agree that Meetlete retains the right to create reasonable limits
          on Meetlete’s use and storage of Your Content, such as limits on file size, storage space, processing
          capacity, and similar limits described on the Platform and as otherwise determined by Meetlete in its sole

              <p>17.1. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</b> You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to your access or use of the Platform, to any products sold or distributed through the Platform, or to any aspect of your relationship with Meetlete, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify,; and (2) you or Meetlete may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  <b>This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all claims that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.</b>
              </p>

              <p>17.2. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Arbitration Rules and Forum.</b> The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent: Legalinc Corporate Services Inc., 651 N. Broad St., Suite 206, Middletown, Delaware 19709.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.  Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at<a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/</a> ; all other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at <a href="http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/">http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.</a>  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, Meetlete will pay them for you.  In addition, Meetlete will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous.</p>
              <p>
                  You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
              </p>


              <p>17.3. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Authority of Arbitrator.</b> The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Meetlete.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.
              </p>

              <p>17.4. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Waiver of Jury Trial.</b> YOU AND MEETLETE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and Meetlete are instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section [17.1] above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.  However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.
              </p>

              <p>17.5. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.</b> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given claim for relief, then the claim must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of California.  All other claims shall be arbitrated.
              </p>

              <p>17.6. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">30-Day Right to Opt Out.</b> You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: [insert email address], within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.  Your notice must include your name and address, your Meetlete username (if any), the email address you used to set up your Meetlete account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.
              </p>

              <p>17.7. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Severability.</b> Except as provided in subsection [17.5], if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
              </p>


              <p>17.8. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Survival of Agreement.</b> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Meetlete.

              <p>17.9. <b class="legalSpaceLeft">Modification.</b> Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Meetlete makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing Meetlete at the following address: Meetlete, Inc., 2907 Shelter Island Dr., Ste. 105 PMB 2955, San Diego, California 92106 or legal@meetlete.com.
